# syber_project
the ec2 machines are currently turned off.
this project is meant to help people browse anonymsly on the internet.
this project was built for a windows operating system.
at the moment this project works only for http protocol.

 instructions:
 To start the system, first go to the proxy settings (enter the computer's settings and in the search bar write proxy settings) and enter the server's IP address there (the address is not fixed, so you need to adjust and change the address accordingly). The port is fixed, so you can enter the port number once and leave it fixed - the port number is 3128.
  
It is important to remember to click save after that in order to execute the changes
Then go to the proxy server and enter an anaconda command prompt that is on the main screen (need to enter specific For an anaconda because there is no Python command line in the proxy, go to write the following line of code:

Cd Documents

(Instead of doing this you can just run the Python command straight away and then the exact location of the file in quotes)
Write this line because Python's executable file is in this folder. Then write the following:

Python proxy2.py

The file should then give an indication that it is starting.
If he starts to see if we really surf anonymously, go to the http server (in my project I did a proxy for http and only theoretically dealt with https but in the end I did not proxy combine their sleep) - a site I used is:

http://www.rashim.co.il/

After entering the site we have to go back to the proxy and see that in cmd it is written that there was communication between it and the server of heads. If this communication exists, it means that it worked and we surfed anonymously to heads.
